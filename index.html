            <h3 class="title4">FRITZ</h3>
            <p class="text3">
              To say that Fritz was born with motor oil in his blood is an
              understatement! Growing up, he was fueled by his parents’ passion
              for custom cars and motorsports. In fact, Fritz spent most of his
              afternoons and weekends tinkering around their auto repair shop,
              at shows, or on the racetrack. At a young age (perhaps a precursor
              to his future), he would modify his toys because he just couldn’t
              leave them stock.
            </p>
            <p class="text3">
              Later, Fritz would grow that talent into a career in automotive
              services and customs, eventually taking his builds to SEMA,
              partnering with Goodguys Rod and Custom, and building many other
              high-end vehicles. As well as developing relationships with
              vendors, Fritz has personally built a ‘67 and ‘68 Chevy C10, a ‘54
              GMC, a ‘73 International Travelette (featured on prime time TV),
              and a ‘66 pro-street Nova. His custom builds have been showcased
              in Classic Trucks magazine as well as the JEGS High Performance
              catalog.
            </p>
            <p class="text3">
              Today, Fritz is thrilled to help Customs by Cochran customers
              create daily drivers that stand apart from the crowd.
